The shortened link will automatically be pasted to the clipboard and will overwrite the former content. Use it by pasting it wherever you like.

If the checkbox *Monitor clipboard* is activated, the app will monitor the clipboard in the background, shorten any Amazon link it finds and paste the shortened link back to the clipboard.
